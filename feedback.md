In my feedback for Practical4, it said that my commit messages for week 4 are not informative.

In my feedback for Practical5, the main problem is that I failed to display the first 10 values of the triangle sequence. So in the triangle.py, after the code in line 14, I added an ‘if’ loop, if the ‘N' that presents the number of triangles is smaller than 10, the number of dots will be printed.

In my feedback for Practical6, task1, the problems began to appear in the third requirement. The original codes could not run since I wrongly used the double dictionary. After adding a dict2 at line 15 that contains the inner part of the original dict, the ages and the risk could be correctly connected and then the scatter plot can be printed. I also added the labels and title to make the scatter plot more detailed and easier to understand.
For task2, at first, I forgot to import the library of matplot. Thus, the plot could not be printed at all. So I added it in line 5. After completing the boxplot, the following results could be seen.
